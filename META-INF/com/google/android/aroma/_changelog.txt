ArchiDroid 2.4

- [!] ArchiDroid 2.X Optimizations finished
* From now on, ArchiDroid 2.X is compiled with optimization for speed for all targets (arm and thumb) (-O2)
# In general we have 3 candidates for optimization level - optimize for speed (O2), optimize for speed yet more (O3) and optimize for size (Os)
# By default target ARM (low-level binary code, about 10% of Android) is compiled with O2, and target THUMB (90% of Android) is compiled with Os
# These flags have been set back in Android gingerbread/froyo times, when we were low on RAM, low on raw I/O and low on CPU, but they're still recent and active
# I made bunch of tests to make a final statement on what gives the best results nowadays
# Os gives up to 20% smaller code and up to 5x slower code compared to O2
# In most cases Os saves no more than 10% of code size, and effects in about 3x slower code compared to O2
# O3 gives up to 80% bigger code and up to 1.5x faster code compared to O2
# In most cases, O3 gives about 50% larger binary, and effects in no more than a few percent faster code compared to O2
# These values were determined by me in a bunch of C/C++ benchmarks, with one being shared by me on xda
# However, due to the fact that Android is an operating system and not a benchmark, we need to think about speed of the code, but also about a memory and cpu cache (size of the code)
# In practice, O2 results in about 6MB bigger /system partition, but keeping in mind the number of combined files, this is no more than a few percent of size increase per each binary
# However, thanks to O2 flag, all binaries and the whole OS is now much faster and responsive, this is due to the fact that Os does not optimize for cpu cache or memory, but for
# the plain code size which results in code being much slower than usual, because we're trying to make smallest possible code instead of giving freedom to GCC, and optizimizing speed/size accordingly
#
# However, this is a bit experimental change, as it affects more than 90% of whole build. For instance, mount.exfat doesn't work correctly with O2 and I needed to use Os for this binary
# See http://jira.omnirom.org/browse/OMNI-796 for more info
# Luckily I couldn't find any more issues

- Improved internal ArchiDroid components used during flashing
- Added 260 DPI and 300 DPI, thanks to above
- Added 2 new ArchiDroid bootanimations, thanks to @DroidShift79
