ArchiDroid 2.5.3

- [!] Adlinux code review
# ArchiDroid's Pocket Debian has been rewritten from scratch to become more user friendly
# If you've already used APD before, I suggest to call "adlinux rebuild" in order to update, as this release also includes updated Pocket Debian
# Adlinux command is now more newbie friendly and allows even easier mounting than before
# It now takes care of things such as setting password or allowing root access by OpenSSH, to minimize required skill for using APB to the bare minimum

- [!] ArchiDroid 2.X is now built with latest Linaro 4.9.2 (again) # This is due to resolved google play bug
- [!] Enabling Navigation bar in AROMA now will also disable corresponding hardware keys (BACK, HOME, MENU)
- Added Superuser selection to AROMA. You can now choose between Chainfire's SuperSU, Koush's Superuser and None
- ArchiDroid's backend now creates a "rainbow" from LEDs during booting process # Perfect way to tell if backend has been executed properly
- Removed BBS app as per developer request
- Reverted Modem back to XXUGNA8 # There's no point in including UB modems
