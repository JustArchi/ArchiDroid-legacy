ArchiDroid 1.7.4

- [!] Bloatware reworked
# 1. ArchiDroid is now packed with "useful" bloatware by default. This includes Samsung E-mail, Accuweather, LiveWallpapers, Samsung Cloud and Allshare (from old bloatware)
# Bloatware package is still available, however now it includes only very rarely installed bloatware, such as yahoo widget or chaton.
# Community decides what should be put into ArchiDroid and what should be kept in generic bloatware package. So available bloatware may change in the future according to YOU! :)
#
# 2. ArchiDroid now gives you possibility to select which bloatware you want in aroma wizard, thus flashing specific bloatware never was easier
# As for now you have an option to choose all packages described in point 1. Additionally you can get rid of: Video player, Calendar, Voice recorder, My files, Music, Calculator, Radio, Gallery, Kies, Browser and some misc things such as remote control service, share shot service, keystring and more.
# Please notice that removing bloatware never works flawlessly out of box, especially because Samsung changes it's apps frequently. I tried my best to make these options indepdent of each other and give you real and easy way to select what you want, however I can't assure you that you won't face FCs because of removed bloatware.
# I flashed a test build with all of these options enabled (all bloatware removed from aroma) and what I can say, I have 15 apps available in menu, about 420 MB of free ram and no FCs at least so far. So more or less it should work good, but I couldn't test every available scenario and app functionality.
#
# Overall I think that this is one of the "most awaiting" features in ArchiDroid 1.X, so it should be a nice christmas present for you :)
