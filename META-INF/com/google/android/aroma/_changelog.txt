ArchiDroid 2.3.6

- [!] Implemented ArchiDroid Partition Wizard and full F2FS support for /system /preload /cache(*) /data(*)
# Option for reformatting to F2FS is only available if your custom recovery and chosen kernel support it
# Reformatting is optional, by default ArchiDroid won't perform any action
# Please note that you can't reformat /cache due to mount-lock of installer, and /data if you're flashing from internal sd card
# Those partitions can be reformatted manually from recovery if needed

- [!] Reworked recovery flashing
# Now you can flash recovery TRULY before ArchiDroid flashing
# If you choose recovery flashing option, ArchiDroid won't be flashed at all, instead, it will flash your recovery and then reboot it (recovery)
# If any recovery update will be needed in the future, this way you won't need to do it manually anymore (as long as proper recovery is available in ArchiDroid)

- [!] Updated sources # TAG=android-4.4.2_r2 BUILD_ID=KVT49L

- Added Devil's Recovery
# This is the only recovery with F2FS support for now, you can use above reworked method to flash it right from ArchiDroid itself

- BACKEND: No longer located in init.d. # I'm tired of all stupid apps deleting all init.d scripts, so backend is now located in /system/xbin and called by fallback (only)
- BACKEND: RunOnce doesn't require hard reboot anymore, soft one is enough
- BACKEND: Fixed backend not being executed in some scenarios (yes, this fixes also root problem)
- AROMA: Fixed reboot recovery option being stuck (after recovery flashing) on some recent recoveries
- AROMA: Fixed pointless ArchiDroid Detect question during flashing recovery
- AROMA: Disabled all incompatible reformats, this includes /data repartition not possible when flashing from intsd, and /cache repartition impossible in all scenarios
- ADBLOCK: Added FORCE_LOCAL_DNSES, which may be useful in case of wrong answers from global DNSes but good from local ones, which are slower than global ones. Disabled by default
- ADBLOCK: Fixed adblock not working on some kernels
- Added GravityBox Xposed module
- Xposed is now pre-activated if chosen in aroma, this also acts as a nice workaround for failed xposed install on f2fs /system (accidentally)
- Enabled SuperSU Pro features for all (shh!)
- Removed OpenPDroid # It's EOL'ed now
